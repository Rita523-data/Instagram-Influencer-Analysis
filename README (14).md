# Problem Statement

The marketing team wanted to analyze their Instagram account performance to:

- Understand which content types and categories drive **higher engagement and follower growth.**

- Identify **high-performing** posts and optimal posting times.

- Evaluate **audience behavior** and trends over time.

- Although raw data existed, there was **no structured analysis** to extract actionable insights.
To solve this, **10 ad-hoc SQL business** questions were provided, focusing on engagement, reach, impressions, and follower trends.

# **Key Insights:**

- Reels dominate: They contribute to over 60% of total reach and have the highest impressions.

- Q2 (April–June) is the most effective period for engagement and follower growth.

- Weekends show higher visibility and interaction compared to weekdays.

- Tech and gadget-related content (Mobile, Tech Tips) consistently perform best.

- Carousels underperform with <1% reach — can be reduced or repurposed.

- Engagement grows steadily from Q1 → Q3, indicating positive momentum.

# **💡 Recommendations:**

**Focus More on Reels:**

- Post 3–4 Reels per week using trending audio and short storytelling.

- Reels deliver 61% of total reach — the most powerful format.

**Optimize Posting During High-Engagement Periods**

- Best months: April–June.

- Maintain consistent posting during weekends for better visibility.

**Prioritize Top Performing Categories**

- Focus on Mobile and Tech Tips categories for higher interaction.

- Rework low-performing categories (like Smartwatch) with better visuals or storytelling.

**Boost Sharing with CTA (Call to Action)**

- Use “Tag a Friend” or “Share if you agree” captions to increase organic shares.

**Maintain Content Variety**

- Keep 4–6 categories per month for balanced engagement.

- Reduce Carousel posts (<1% reach).

**Use Data-Driven Strategy for Campaigns**

- Utilize top-performing dates (from Q9) to plan influencer campaigns.
